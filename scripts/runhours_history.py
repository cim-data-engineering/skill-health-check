"""Load offloaded PEAK point history for the run-hours check.

Not a general history loader — this reads `platform.history` results that the
platform offloaded to disk for the run-hours check only, keyed on BACnet
favourite ids. The other health-check reports do not use it.

Two hazards it exists to handle, both of which corrupt results silently:

1. The offloaded payload's shape varies by client — an MCP text-block wrapper,
   a bare ``{"results": [...]}`` dict, or a bare list.
2. The tool-results directory is shared across concurrent sessions, so a file
   may carry rows for fav_ids that are not yours, and one chunk's rows may be
   split across several files.

Usage as a library (the normal case)::

    from runhours_history import load_rows
    rows = load_rows(paths, fav_ids)

Usage as a CLI, for a sanity check that prints only derived counts::

    python3 runhours_history.py <fav_ids_csv> <file.json> [more.json ...]

Standard library only — no third-party dependencies, by design, so the script
runs wherever the skill is unpacked.
