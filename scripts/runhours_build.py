"""Turn a run-hours plan and its history pulls into the view's aggregate.

Usage:
    python3 runhours_build.py <workdir> <history.json> [more.json ...] [--pass 2]

Reads <workdir>/window.json and plan.json, loads the pulled history, decides
each unit's row — status or analog, whichever shows less running — and writes
<workdir>/agg.json (the renderer's only input) and <workdir>/days.csv (per unit
per day, for follow-ups). Prints the notes to state with the view.

--pass 2 adds the later pass once its history has been pulled; pass every
history file from both passes.

Standard library only — no third-party dependencies, by design, so the script
runs wherever the skill is unpacked.
